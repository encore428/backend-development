Create an Express.js server application that publishes its heartbeat

● A WebSocket endpoint `/heartbeat` that sends heartbeat messages to clients.

● A producer that publishes `heartbeat` messages to the `heartbeat` queue.

● A consumer that subscribes to the `heartbeat` queue and writes the messages to a file `log.txt` (append-mode)

Heartbeat messages to send/publish:

● Every minute: “I’m alive at ${datetime}!”

● Every 42nd minute of the hour: “42 is the meaning to life!”
